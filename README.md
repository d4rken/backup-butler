### Archived

Backup Butler was never launched. I got it to "almost" alpha stage, but ultimative didn't have the time (or motiviation?) to continue.
Some of the internal code (e.g. `IO Gateways` or root handling) made it's way into [SD Maid 2/SE](https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se).

I'm archiving the project to free up space in my mind. I don't see myself launching it. Other ideas currently motivate me more.
